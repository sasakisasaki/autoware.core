  * feat: function to smooth the route (see below)
  Description:
  This commit is kind of feature porting from `autoware.universe` as follows
  * Import `PathWithLaneId DefaultFixedGoalPlanner::modifyPathForSmoothGoalConnection` from the following `autoware.universe` code
  https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe/blob/a0816b7e3e35fbe822fefbb9c9a8132365608b49/planning/behavior_path_planner/autoware_behavior_path_goal_planner_module/src/default_fixed_goal_planner.cpp#L74-L104
  * Also import all related functions from the `autoware.universe` side
  * style(pre-commit): autofix
  * bugs: fix remaining conflicts
  * Update planning/autoware_path_generator/src/utils.cpp

  * bug: fix missing header in the path
  * This finally causes an issue that the vehicle cannot engage
  * bug: fix an issue that smooth connection does not work
  * refactor: simplify code
  * bug: fix wrong pose at the goal (see below)
  * If we return nullopt here, the original path
  whose goal position is located at the center line is used.
  * Unless far from the goal point, the path becomes smoothed one
  whose goal position is located at the side of road correctly.
  * But as the goal approaches very closely, the goal position is
  shifted from smoothed one to the original one
  * Thus, the goal pose finally becomes wrong due to the goal position shift
  * refactor: no need this line here
  * style(pre-commit): autofix
  * bug: fix so we follow the provided review comments
  * bug: sorry, this is unsaved fix, ...
  * cosmetic: fix wrong comment
  * bug: unused function `get_goal_lanelet()` remaining
  * bug: carefully handle the pre goal velocity
  * It seems zero pre goal velocity makes scenario fail
  - We need to insert appropriate velocity for pre goal
